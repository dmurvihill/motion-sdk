## MotionOptions.overrunLimiter property

Rate limiter that tracks how many times we've exceeded the limit recently

**Signature:**

```typescript
overrunLimiter?: RateLimiterAbstract;
```

## Remarks

The default rate limiter will suffice for non-concurrent usage patterns. If you are using multiple [Motion](./motion-sdk.motion.md) objects with the same user ID, make sure each client has the same limiter and uses the same key.

An "overrun" refers an instance of exceeding Motion's maximum number of requests per minute and receiving a 429 Limit Exceeded response. Too many overruns results in automatic and permanent lockout.
