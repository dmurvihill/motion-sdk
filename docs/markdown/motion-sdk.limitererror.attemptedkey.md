## LimiterError.attemptedKey property

The rate limiter key that was attempted.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly attemptedKey?: (string | number) | undefined;
```

## Remarks

An [rate-limiter-flexible](https://github.com/animir/node-rate-limiter-flexible/wiki) tracks the same limit independently across multiple keys. In some cases it is important to know which particular key is returning errors.
